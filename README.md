Hello :smiley: 

So here I am trying my hands out with **Next.js**. For this I have build a simple login and sign-up page with basics of Next.js. I have borrowed the design from [https://dribbble.com/shots/15392711-Dashboard-Login-Sign-Up](https://dribbble.com/shots/15392711-Dashboard-Login-Sign-Up). Do visit their page for more such exciting designs.

Coming back to my project. I have used Static routes for routing and for styling I used both styled jsx and CSS modules as a part of learning. Apart from this I have also used Next.js in-build **<Head**> tag to modify the metadata of the page and **<Image**> tag to add assests to my website. The other aspects of the project is more or less same as React.js After this initial run I feel a bit confident about this new framework. :wink:
  
  Please take a look at my website which is still under progress:
